# CS443-Software-Security-Tools
This is tools that I have built and collaborated for the purpose of scoring for CS443 in SMU. The module is about Software Systems and Security and deals with basic stuff such as Stack-based Buffer Overflows, String Format Vulnerabilities and learning how to use the GDB

Note: This repository may evolve to something more in the future. For now, it is just where I am gonna dump stuff that I build for fun or scripts I wrote for fun
